# SM-DYS-Round-Info
Sourcemod plugin for Dystopia that shows the round info in a top-left game message

# Usage  
Use the command `sm_rounds` to get the round info

# Requirements  
Main branch of the plugin requires a binary patch made by Snoopkirby to make votes for `mp_rounds` apply instantly, another branch has a more complex plugin for servers without the patch.
